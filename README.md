# 🚗 Java Object-Oriented Vehicle Management System

This is a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Java project simulating an elementary **Vehicle System**. It illustrates fundamental OOP principles including **abstraction**, **inheritance**, **interfaces**, and **polymorphism** via vehicles such as **Cars** and **Bikes** — with the ability to **Electric Vehicles**.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `App.java`: Main entry for object usage demonstration.
- `Main.java`: Illustrates memory allocation principles.
- `Vehicle.java`: Abstract class with essential vehicle methods.
- `Bike.java`: Subclass of Vehicle.
- `Car.java`: Subclass of Vehicle, implements ElectricVehicle.
- `ElectricVehicle.java`: Interface with EV-specific methods.

## 🎯 Features Exhibited

| Concept | Description |

|------------------|-------------|
| **Abstraction** | `Vehicle` is an abstract class that specifies the blueprint for all vehicles |
| **Inheritance** | `Bike` and `Car` classes extend `Vehicle` |
| **Interfaces** | `Car` implements `ElectricVehicle` interface |
| **Polymorphism** | Methods perform differently depending on subclass implementation
| **Types of Memory** | `Main.java` discusses `heap`, `stack`, and `method` memory regions |
